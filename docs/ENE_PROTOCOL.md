# ENE K5130 keyboard lighting protocol — Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S AI (PHN16S-71)

Reverse-engineered notes for the LED controller that actually drives the
keyboard backlight on this model. Everything below was verified on real
hardware against a fully dark baseline.

> **AI assistance.** This protocol was reverse-engineered in a session assisted

## 1. Why this exists

The ACPI-WMI lighting path on this model is **partially implemented in
firmware**. Within a single `SET_GAMING_KB_BACKLIGHT` call:

| Field | Result |
|---|---|
| brightness | **applied** |
| RGB | **discarded** |
| effect mode | **discarded** |

And the per-zone call (`SET_GAMING_RGB_KB`) stores the colours, returns them
faithfully on read-back, and never applies them to the LEDs.

That combination is what makes the bug so quiet: every layer above reports
success. **On this model a sysfs read-back is not evidence that anything
happened.** Confirmed by writing red/green/blue/white at full brightness with
all competing writers stopped: read-back exact, keyboard unchanged.

## 2. Transport

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Chip | ENE K5130, HID id `0018:0CF2:5130` |
| Bus | I²C-1, address `0x50`, 400 kHz, GpioInt with wake |
| Protocol | standard HID-over-I2C, **feature reports only** (no Input, no Output) |
| Access | `HIDIOCSFEATURE` on the ENE's hidraw node |
| Readable | only `0xA1`. `0xA2`/`0xA3`/`0xA4` are **write-only** — a GET returns an echo of the command, not data |

**Resolve the node by HID identity, never by hidraw number.** The numbering is
not stable here: the ENE's reset times out during probe so it enumerates last,
and the touchpad can rebind and reclaim `hidraw0`.

## 3. Devices

`0xA1` (4 bytes, read-only) returns `03 65 21 83` — a device count followed by
the device ids.

| Device id | Physical element | How it was verified |
|---|---|---|
| `0x65` | performance-mode button LED | mode 2 → took the exact red requested |
| `0x21` | **keyboard**, 4 zones | mode 2 → bright static green from a dark baseline |
| `0x83` | **lid logo** | mode 2 → follows the requested RGB exactly, from an off baseline |

## 4. Required sequence

```
1)  0xA2 = <device_id>        select device      (1 byte)
2)  0xA4 = <configuration>    apply             (10 bytes)
```

**Step 1 is mandatory.** Without a prior selection using a *valid* device id,
`0xA4` has no effect. Writing an arbitrary value such as `1` is not a
selection — `1` is not one of the enumerated ids — and the handshake silently
fails.

## 5. Report `0xA4` — 10 bytes

| Byte | Usage | Field | Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `0x21` | device id | — | same id selected in `0xA2` |
| 1 | `0x41` | **mode** | 0–31 | see §6. **Semantics are per device** |
| 2 | `0x43` | **brightness** | 0–100 | |
| 3 | `0x42` | **speed** | 0–9 | monotonically faster; see §6.1 |
| 4 | `0x44` | **direction** | 1–2 | see §6.1 |
| 5 | `0x45` | **R** | 0–255 | |
| 6 | `0x46` | **G** | 0–255 | |
| 7 | `0x47` | **B** | 0–255 | |
| 8–9 | `0x48` | **zone bitmask**, 16-bit LE | — | see §7 |

## 6. Modes

**Mode 2 is static colour on all three devices.** Beyond that the map is per
device and does **not** carry over: on the keyboard mode 1 turns it off, on the
button LED mode 1 does nothing at all and mode 6 turns it off. Assuming
otherwise produces silent no-ops — an earlier reading put the button's static
at mode 1, and every write to it quietly did nothing until that was caught.

### Keyboard (`0x21`) — verified

Numbering is the ENE's own and does **not** match the WMI mode numbers other
Acer tools document (0 Static, 1 Breath, 2 Neon, 3 Wave, 4 Shifting, 5 Zoom).
Names below are matched to the effects PredatorSense advertises, **by observed
behaviour**; there is no documented mapping. Modes 8 and 10 are the least
certain: 10 is read as `Shifting` because it is the one with a visible
direction, which matches the documented "shifting light effect, full control
over speed, direction, and colour", leaving 8 as `Meteor`.

| Mode | Observed | Name |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | off | — |
| **2** | **static colour** | Static |
| 4 | smooth fade through pure colours | Breathing |
| 5 | whole board shifts colour at once, no lateral sweep | Neon |
| 6 | as 5, faster | Neon (fast) |
| 7 | lateral rainbow (factory default) | Wave |
| 8 | a point flares at random, then the whole board flashes | Meteor *(tentative)* |
| 9 | circular, outside inward, darkening, colour drifting each cycle | Zoom |
| 10 | light crosses left-to-right then back, board dark behind it | Shifting *(tentative)* |
| 11 | two of the four segments lit at random, then off | Twinkling |
| 12 | static | variant of Static |
| 13–31 | nothing visible | — |

### 6.1 Speed and direction

| Byte | Field | Values |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | speed | `0`–`9`, rising monotonically |
| 4 | direction | `1` left→right · `2` right→left |

⚠️ **The direction encoding is the reverse of the convention used by Archer and
the Linuwu-Sense docs**, where `2` means left-to-right. Anything bridging the
two must translate, or the UI label ends up inverted.

Value `3` in byte 4 produced a trailing-comet variant rather than a third
direction. Not characterised.

### Lid logo (`0x83`) — verified

| Mode | Effect |
|---|---|
| 1 | off |
| **2** | **static colour, honours RGB** |
| 3 | off |
| 4 | fixed red, RGB ignored |
| 5 | slow colour cycle |
| 6 | fixed yellow, RGB ignored |
| 7 | off |

An earlier round concluded the logo did not read the RGB bytes at all, because
the same green was sent with modes 1, 2 and 4 and produced off, green and red.
Three modes with three different behaviours, read as one capricious colour.
Re-tested with the mode held constant at 2 the logo follows red, green, blue
and white exactly, and repeating an identical write repeats the identical
result — so there is no hidden counter either.

### Performance-mode button (`0x65`) — verified

| Mode | Effect |
|---|---|
| 1 | nothing |
| **2** | **static colour, honours RGB** |
| 3 | nothing |
| 4 | breathing, holding the colour |
| 5 | colour cycle |
| 6 | off — and briefly darkens the keyboard too, which the EC restores after a second or two |
| 7 | nothing |
| **≥ 8** | ⚠️ coincided with fans starting and stopping. Probably reaches the performance profile, not just the LED. **Do not sweep this range blindly.** |

## 7. Zone bitmask (bytes 8–9) — verified exhaustively

**A bitmask of the low four bits.** Zones combine in a single write.

| Value | Observed |
|---|---|
| `0x0001` | first quarter (leftmost) |
| `0x0002` | second quarter |
| `0x0004` | third quarter |
| `0x0008` | fourth quarter (rightmost) |
| `0x0003` | **left half** — the test that proves it is a mask, not an index |
| `0x000F` | whole keyboard |
| `0xFFFF` | whole keyboard |
| `0x0100` | **no effect** — the high byte is ignored |

## 8. What does not work

| Path | Result |
|---|---|
| Per-zone colour over **WMI** (`SET_GAMING_RGB_KB`) | stored, read back faithfully, **not applied** |
| Effect mode over **WMI** (`set_kb_status`) | ignored |
| Brightness over **WMI** | ✅ genuinely applied |
| Per-zone buffer via report `0xA3` | ignored — `0xA4` wins. Loading four distinct colours and applying blue produced an all-blue keyboard |

## 9. Worked example — four zones, four colours

```
# select the keyboard, then paint each zone with its own mask
0xA2 = 21
0xA4 = 21 02 64 00 00 FF 00 00 01 00     # zone 1 red
0xA4 = 21 02 64 00 00 00 FF 00 02 00     # zone 2 green
0xA4 = 21 02 64 00 00 00 00 FF 04 00     # zone 3 blue
0xA4 = 21 02 64 00 00 FF FF FF 08 00     # zone 4 white
```

## 10. Competing writers

Three independent actors impose keyboard state on every boot. Any experiment
must silence them or the results are uninterpretable.

| Actor | When | What |
|---|---|---|
| EC / firmware | always | animates over a private channel; can reassert itself |
| `linuwu_sense` | at module load | restores `/etc/four_zone_kb_state` |
| `archer-daemon` | ~2 s after the login screen | restores `/etc/archer/settings.json` |

## 11. Method note

Two conclusions in this work were initially wrong, both for the same reason:
**no baseline was recorded before the first write.** A finding about the lid
logo had to be withdrawn entirely, and a mode value verified on the button LED
was wrongly assumed to hold for the keyboard, invalidating a whole round of
zone testing.

Everything above was re-derived with the keyboard, button LED and lid logo all
dark before each experiment, and with each observation labelled by the exact
parameter that produced it. If you extend this work, keep that discipline: the
failure mode of this hardware is *silent* no-ops, so "nothing changed" carries
almost no information unless the starting state is known.

## 12. Open questions

- Byte 4 value `3`: a trailing-comet variant, not characterised.
- Acer's real per-profile colours for the button LED. Not published, and the
  factory firmware stops driving the LED once this backend takes over, so
  there is nothing left to read them from. The defaults shipped here are a
  choice, not a discovery; only the purple on `balanced-performance` came
  from observed hardware.
